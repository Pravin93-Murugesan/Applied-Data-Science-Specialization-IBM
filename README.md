# Applied Data Science Specialization (IBM)
## Comparing Neighbourhoods in København and Malmö using Python

All work here is based on an intensive course ``Applied Data Science Specialization`` offered by **IBM** through Coursera. I acquired hands-on skills for data science by learning Python.

The course taught me to load, manipulate, analyze cool datasets, use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions, visualize data and findings in a stimulating way. It also gave me a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when data is not readily available. The project work (link given below) refined my skills for exploring and analyzing data.

Through multiple courses within the specialization, I have listed out some key learning outcomes: 
  - **Data Analysis with Python**
    - Using Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries
      - Import datasets
      - Clean the data
      - Data frame manipulation
      - Summarizing the data
      - Building machine learning regression models
  
  - **Data Visualization with Python**
    - Using data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium
      - Visualize data to extract information
      - For better understanding of data
      - To make more effective decisions
      - To present the data in a form that makes sense to people 
      
  - **Applied Data Science Capstone**
    - By making API calls to the Foursquare API and using Folium library
      - Retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world
      - Scraping web data and parsing HTML code 
      - Create maps of geospatial data and communicating the results and findings
